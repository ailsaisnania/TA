Bachelor's degree project in Information technology Undergraduate 30 credits Spring Term 2022 Abstract On the web, data visualisation through charts and diagrams can help present data in a more readable way. This is often done through the usage of JavaScript libraries. We experimented with 5 JavaScript data visualisation libraries to determine their respective performances and how each one scaled with increased data size. Our results will hopefully provide help with the selection of said libraries. The results show a significant difference in response times between all libraries for most data sizes, with only a few exceptions. Different exponential growths were also identified for all libraries, and the performance often varied greatly depending on chart type. Response time is not the only variable in performance measurements. Future research could cover other aspects, like memory consumption and rendering requirements. There were also times when the libraries did not render at larger data sizes, despite showing no errors, and further investigation behind this should be done.},

JavaS-cript can be used to create such visualisations, but it is easier to do so using libraries expressly created for that purpose. D3.js and Chart.js are two examples of such libraries. Though both are free to use, for a long time the two were hardly mentioned together. This thesis aims to analyse the core functionalities of the two libraries and compare them on different metrics. By going through the differences between D3.js and Chart.js, this works aims to find out the practical ramifications of those differences and the kind of applications each library is best suited for. The results of the work carried out for this thesis indicate that D3.js is faster and tends to use less memory than Chart.js, except when it must render a high amount of object, in which case its memory performance breaks down. D3.js offers more features than Chart.js, but its usage is far more complex and requires more time and effort from the developer. As a result, D3.js is best suited for applications where performance is important or the visualisation is complex, whereas Chart.js is better used for straightforward charts with simple requirements.},

Render time is important for websites since slow response times can cause users to leave the site. When creating a website with fast render times in mind, the selection of JavaScript library may be crucial. This work aims to determine if dataset size and/or chart type affects the render time of charts created by different JavaScript libraries. The comparison is done by a literature search to identify suitable libraries, followed by an experiment in which 40 websites are created to compare the performance of selected JavaScript libraries for rendering selected chart types. The results show that while both dataset size and chart type affect the render time in most cases, the libraries scale differently depending on the dataset size.},

Poor scalability can result in poor system performance, necessitating the reengineering or duplication of systems. While scalability is valued, its characteristics and the characteristics that undermine it are usually only apparent from the context. Here, we attempt to define different aspects of scalability, such as structural scalability and load scalability. Structural scalability is the ability of a system to expand in a chosen dimension without major modifications to its architecture. Load scalability is the ability of a system to perform gracefully as the offered traffic increases. It is argued that systems with poor load scalability may exhibit it because they repeatedly engage in wasteful activity, because they are encumbered with poor scheduling algorithms, because they cannot fully take advantage of parallelism, or because they are algorithmically inefficient. We qualitatively illustrate these concepts with classical examples from the literature of operating systems and local area networks, as well as an example of our own. Some of these are accompanied by rudimentary delay analysis.},
